**A. Problem**

A diet is an eating pattern that involves the conscious selection of foods and beverages to meet nutritional needs. There are different types of diets, including balanced, vegetarian, vegan, ketogenic, paleo and Mediterranean diets. In Indonesia, diet-related health concerns include increased obesity, consumption of processed foods, and health problems such as diabetes. The availability of nutritious and affordable food is a concern.

Dietary programs play a crucial role in addressing diet-related health issues. A structured and personalized program can help individuals achieve a healthy weight, reduce the risk of chronic diseases, and improve well-being. Implementation of diet programs also contributes to improved quality of life and longevity.

Mobile apps, such as Wise Life, can support the effectiveness of diet programs. The app provides a platform to track food intake, monitor physical activity and set dietary goals. Real-time feedback and personalized recommendations can improve dietary adherence and outcomes. The integration of technology in dietary management has the potential to positively impact public health in Indonesia and beyond.

**B. Goals**

The goal of a diet app is to help a person achieve and maintain a healthy weight through the management of diet and physical activity. Here are some of the main objectives of diet apps:
1. **Calorie Counting**: Helps users calculate their daily calorie intake based on their weight, height, age, and physical activity level. This helps one understand how many calories they need to achieve their weight goals.
2. **Diet and Nutrition Monitoring**: Allows users to record the food as well as nutrients in food, such as proteins, carbohydrates, and fats that they consume throughout the day. With these records, users can identify unhealthy eating patterns and make changes accordingly.
3. **Progress Analysis**: Tracks the user's progress, such as changes in weight, body mass index (BMI), or other body measurements. This helps users see if they are achieving their weight goals.

**C. Main Features**
1. **Personalization**: The app will ask a number of questions related to personal data, such as the purpose of use, weight, height, or medical history in order to provide a suitable diet program for the user.
2. **Food Consumption Monitoring**: Diet apps allow users to log and track what they eat on a daily basis. This helps them be aware of their diet and identify potential changes that need to be made.
3. **Calorie Counting**: The app provides calorie counting for each type of food and drink consumed. This helps users manage their calorie intake according to their goals, be it to lose weight or maintain a healthy weight.
4. **Progress Monitoring**: The app allows users to see their progress over time, such as weight changes, body measurements, and achieving their diet goals.
